        <p class = 'fs-5'>The Drop - May 2023</p>
        <p class = 'fs-6'>This is a unity game concept made within a week as part of my DMU work experience. This was developed by me and another person on the work experience course. This is a simple game that involves the player falling through a map, avoiding randomly generated obstacles. There is also a dash power to help the player avoid obstacles. </p>

        <p class = 'fs-5'>Weather Website Template - November 2023</p>
        <p class = 'fs-6'>This website was originally used to research how to implement features into the final assessment piece we were tasked to make for the T Level course. Since finishing the course, I have fleshed it out further into a full weather forecast website, air quality forecast, placeholder articles and other features. 
        This website was made primarily using PHP, with weather API's such and openweathermap and tomorrow.io.</p>
