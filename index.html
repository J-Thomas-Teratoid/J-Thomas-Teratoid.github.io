                <p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio website.</p>
                <p>I am a young developer that is just starting his journing into the industry after completing my level 3 qualification, and I am currently building my experience while seeking an role in software. I have the most experience with web development with PHP, though I've also know other languages such as JavaScript, CSS, SQL and C# through my projects in unity.</p>

                        <p class = 'fs-6'>This website was originally used to research how to implement features into the final assessment piece we were tasked to make for the T Level course. Since finishing the course, I have fleshed it out further into a full weather forecast website, air quality forecast, placeholder articles and other features. 
                        This website was made primarily using PHP, with weather API's such and openweathermap and tomorrow.io.</p>

                        <p class = 'fs-6'>This is a unity game concept made within a week as part of my DMU work experience. This was developed by me and another person on the work experience course. This is a simple game that involves the player falling through a map, avoiding randomly generated obstacles. There is also a dash power to help the player avoid obstacles. </p>
