                        <p>I am a young developer that is just starting his journing into the industry after completing my level 3 qualification, and I am currently building my experience while seeking a role in software. This website is a collection of the projects I currently have that I have worked on over my time as a developer. While this isn't all of the projects I have worked on, this website exists as a showcase of my development journey throughout the years of me working on projects.</p>

                        <p class = 'fs-6'>This website was originally used to research how to implement features into the final assessment piece we were tasked to make for the T Level course. Since finishing the course, I have fleshed it out further into a full weather forecast website, air quality forecast, placeholder articles and other features. There is even a login system for the website that hashes the user's password, though the email isn't checked to confirm it is real, so you don't have to put personal information on this website, as the login is only used for the health tracker feature.<br><br>
                        This website was made primarily using PHP, with weather API's such and openweathermap, Froala text editor and tomorrow.io.</p>

                        <p class = 'fs-6'>This is a unity game concept made within a week as part of a game jam that we did at DeMonfort University on work experience. This was developed by me and a friend on the work experience course. <br><br>
                        This is a simple dropper game that involves the player falling through a map, avoiding randomly generated obstacles, with a dash ability for avoiding harder obstacles and ring powerups that will speed up or slow down the drop rate of the player.<br><br>
                        Both me and my friend worked on the code for this game. I also worked on most of the models, excluding the cloud models, which are from <a href = 'https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/3le-low-poly-cloud-pack-65911'>The Fallout Nerd's 3LE Low Poly Cloud Pack</a>. While this game is very barebones, there were many features of this game that was a challenge to develop, such as the level generation.</p>
