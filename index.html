This website is a collection of the projects I currently have that I have worked on over my time as a developer. While this isn't all of the projects I have worked on, this website exists as a showcase of my development journey throughout the years of me working on projects.</p>

                        <p>This website was originally used to research how to implement features into the final assessment piece we were tasked to make for the T Level course. Since finishing the course, I have fleshed it out further into a full weather forecast website, air quality forecast, placeholder articles and other features. There is even a login system for the website that hashes the user's password, though the email isn't checked to confirm it is real, so you don't have to put personal information on this website, as the login is only used for the health tracker feature.<br><br>
                        This website was made primarily using PHP, with weather API's such and openweathermap, Froala text editor and tomorrow.io.</p>

                        <h5>The Drop - May 2023</h5>
                        <p>This is a unity game concept made within a week as part of a game jam that was done at De Monfort University during the work experience role I undertoke. This was developed by me and a friend on the work experience course. <br><br>
                        This is a simple dropper game that involves the player falling through a map, avoiding randomly generated obstacles, with a dash ability for avoiding harder obstacles and ring powerups that will speed up or slow down the drop rate of the player.<br><br>
                        Both me and my friend worked on the code for this game. I also worked on most of the models, excluding the cloud models, which are from <a href = 'https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/3le-low-poly-cloud-pack-65911'>The Fallout Nerd's 3LE Low Poly Cloud Pack</a>. While this game is very barebones, there were many features of this game that was a challenge to develop, such as the level generation.</p>

                        <h5>Narcicuss & Echo: A VR Dance Experience - January 2023</h5>
                        <p>This is a unity VR expereince prototype based on the the story of ancient greek story Narcicuss & Echo. This was created at De Montfort University during the work experience I undertoke.<br><br>
                        This VR experience was worked on by all work placement students that attended during this period and was assigned to us by the placement coordinators, one of whom works in dance and arts.<br><br> 
                        This expereince allows the player to move around and view the environment that represents the story. There are also interactable objects around the environment, such as the torches and rocks in the cave. There are also uses on motion and volumetric capture in this proof of concept.<br><br>
                        My role in this project was less focused on the coding and more on the creation of the environment and testing, though I did program functionality in the environment such as the movement of the water. <br><br>
